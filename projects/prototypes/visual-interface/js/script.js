This is a program linking jQuery interfaces with p5, and
hydra : ojack Experimental package for running hydra in atom.

Also includes p5.js, support for OSC channels, and for live coding with javascript in general.

`as you can see, it's not important that the Circles are in p5.
the important part is that we are communicating with a JavaScript class`

Pippin's advice on hydra
leverage functions like sin(), cos(), tan(), noise() that produce patterns over time as you vary a variable (like the angle or timestep). Another is using iteration to draw many slightly varied basic shapes (e.g. a for-loop that draws a bunch of lines, each at a slightly diifferent angle)

  let myCanvas = createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight/2);
  //places the canvas in a <div>
  //(so you can move the div around if you wish)
  myCanvas.parent("canvasContainer");

  //Generates 10 buttons and their actions
  generateButtons();

  //generate the circles;

    ////IMPORTANT PART////

      //We want to change the size of all the circles in our array.
      //I chose the size to be 10 times the button number.
      //so if i click on "button 2", circle size will be 20.
      //you can make it whatever you want.
