Night at the Movie - Dead Poets Society mashup

My interests in creative coding lies in the symbolic of the movements of elements within recursive functions. To achieve this vision, I am loading classical literature texts files and contextualize them in a visual poetry experiment.

This activity offers a glimpse into a larger realms of computer controls and codes, where one can measure the impact of their words but also witness the powerful play at work; one aspect of Shakespearian theater.
As humans dive deeper into constructing for themselves a world to inhabit, I am questioning the thresholds of where and when we will find ourselves unable to adapt to our own creations. (When spanned words cloud creates a infinite scrolling and makes it impossible to interact with anything new)

Being a powerful source of knowledge and archives, the RiTa.js library builds the relationship between current data/text processing and past poetry. It opens to a wide lexicon of rhythms of speeches and worked smoothly with JSON objects. Adding it to the project was my way to revisit the past centuries while adding a touch of current culture. (Dead Poets Society)

To make the code more interesting visually, I plan to divide my canvas into
vertical sections, containing the tokenized poetry, and animate those sections with sin()
to create a sine wave within a sine wave and perhaps create visually interesting loops.
Having DanceSpan as a separate file allows me to conveniently add animations to my
canvas elements, here words, later imagery? I also wish to create another visual
ripple animation after the user interaction.
